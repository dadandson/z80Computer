64K total addressable memory on Z80

If we want 16K ROM: 2^13
	- If bit 14 or 15 bit is set: route memory address to SRAM chip
	- Bit 14 set: 
		- route to SRAM chip
		bit 15 set: turn on bit 14 on SRAM chip
If we want 32K ROM: 2^14
	- If bit 15 is set: route memory address to SRAM

if SRAM chips have a read/write enable maybe able to use it to enable / disable sram
